## `Installing Emma`

### `Step 1`

Download ['emma-language-learning'](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/emma-language-learning) and ['emma-language-learning-api'](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/emma-language-learning-api) and make sure to create a .env file on the client side which includes a port where the server can run. Emma was running on port 8080 in production, therefore, we recommend using the same.


### `Step 2`

Run `npm install` on the client and server side to download all dependencies.


### `Step 3`

Run `npm run migrate` and `npm run seed` on the server side to populate the SQL database.


### `Step 4`

You're almost done! On the client side run `npm run dev` to launch the application and `npx nodemon` on the server side to start the server. Welcome to Emma!

Have fun! ðŸŒ»
